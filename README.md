ProPic
======

View Instagram profile pictures in full resolution.

## Description
ProPic allows users to view Instagram users' profile pictures in full resolution, a feature that was inexplicably left out of the app itself.
  
  **NOTE:** The profile pictures will be somewhat blurry and pixelated when displayed. Instagram only expects to use them inside its small, circular image views, and as a result, the profile pictures are scaled down when first uploaded, causing this blurriness.

## How to use Propic
  * Open Instagram.
  * Tap on a user's username or profile picture.
  * Tap on their profile picture when their user page is displayed.
  * A larger image view containing the user's profile picture will animate in view on-screen.
## Compatibility
  * ProPic works with the most recent version of Instagram available (6.2.2), iOS 8.0+, and all iDevice models.
